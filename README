This distribution includes the ruthesis document class for preparing Rutgers
dissertation manuscripts in LaTeX (ruthesis.cls).  It also includes a LaTeX
template for use of the ruthesis document class (in the template folder).
Also, in the bibtexery folder are some BibTeX style files useful for the
typesetting of bibliographies (including C.V. publication lists) that satisfy
the requirements of the Rutgers Graduate School.

The ruthesis document class and the accompanying template are documented in the
file: template/dissertationTemplate.pdf.
