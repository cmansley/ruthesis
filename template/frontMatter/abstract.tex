The abstract of the dissertation.

The second paragraph of the abstract.
\note{These paragraphs should obviously be replaced with a real abstract. (Notes like these are created with the $\backslash$\texttt{note} command.  They can be systematically hidden by setting the \texttt{notes} boolean in the document's \href{./dissertation.tex}{root source file}.)}
