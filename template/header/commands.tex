%% font, indiciative of a non-scalar variable.
\newcommand{\vectorize}[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbf#1}}

%% Define a \degree command as a shortcut to produce the degrees symbol.
%% (We use \providecommand so that if the author is using a package that
%% already provides a nice degree symbol, it won't be replaced).
\providecommand{\degree}{\ensuremath{^\circ}}

%% If you want to use unit notation without worrying about whether you are in
%% math-mode, you can define a nice consistent typesetting

\newcommand{\naive}{na\"{\i}ve}

%% Maybe you have a file of notation commands that you always use.
%% No problem.  Just import it here.  Note that since we imported this file
%% (rather than \inputting or \including it), the path to your file is
%% relative to this directory.
