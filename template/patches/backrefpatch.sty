%% The standard backref.sty does this processing in \BR@starttoc.
%% However, this seems to cause problems in that while compiling,
%% \@writefile commands are issued to write \backcite commands to
%% the jobname.brf file, but (since \BR@starttoc can be triggered
%% multiple times throughout the document) the .brf file is read
%% (by the \@input command) before the \@writefile commands have
%% been flushed.
%% As a workaround, we move the commands from \BR@starttoc to the
%% beginning of the document and add a (possibly unnecessary)
%% block to close the output stream if it is open.
%% One side effect of this change seems to be that when using
%% bibunits, if a reference cross-references another reference
%% (e.g., a chapter referencing the book that it is in), the
%% cross-reference will link to the reference in the first
%% bibliography in which it appears (rather than the local
%% bibliography), and a backref link for the cross-referenced
%% reference will be generated only to the cross-referer in the
%% global bibliography (and to citations in the text).
