%% This file is the header file used to perform chapter-specific configuration
%% for one chapter in the dissertation template.
%% This file is for preamble commands that are needed by the chapter (but not
%% generally needed by the document as a whole).
%% There is another file (./chapterHeader) that can be used to perform
%% non-preamble configuration at the start of the chapter.
%% Note that the commands issued (and packages used) here may not _conflict_
%% with the rest of the document; they should play nicely.
%% This file is included by the main header (../header/header.tex).
