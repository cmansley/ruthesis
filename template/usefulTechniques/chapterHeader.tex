%% This file is a pseudo-header file that provides setup for a single chapter.
%% The commands found here might normally be placed in a true header (i.e.,
%% before the \begin{document} command, but then they would affect the whole
%% document, rather than just this chapter.
%% So any commands in this file must be safe to issue in the document body (not
%% the preamble).
%% This file is included by the chapter's root file
%% (./usefulTechniques.tex).

%% The graphicx package defines the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions command that
%% allows the author to specify the search order preference of graphics files
%% extensions.
%% Since pdf and non-pdf flavours of LaTeX have different graphic file format
%% options, we can use the \ifpdf condition to specify two different search
%% orders; then when graphics are inserted (via the \includegraphics command),
%% the author just leaves off the extension.
%% (Of course, compilation will only work in both cases if the author has
%% provided appropriately-extensioned versions of the graphics file).

  %% For this chapter, we are going to deal with LaTeX's inability to compute
  %% bounding boxes for raster files by creating a .bb file for each raster
  %% file (.png, .jpg) that gives the dimensions of the image (in pixels).
  %% These commands let the graphicx package know that when a .png or .jpg
  %% file is included (by \includegraphics), it should look for a file with
  %% the same name but the .bb extension to find the bounding box.
