%% This file is a pseudo-header file that provides setup for a single chapter.
%% The commands found here might normally be placed in a true header (i.e.,
%% before the \begin{document} command, but then they would affect the whole
%% document, rather than just this chapter.
%% So any commands in this file must be safe to issue in the document body (not
%% the preamble).
%% This file is included by the chapter's root file
%% (./manySubfigs.tex).

%% The graphicx package defines the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions command that
%% allows the author to specify the search order preference of graphics files
%% extensions.
%% Since pdf and non-pdf flavours of LaTeX have different graphic file format
%% options, we can use the \ifpdf condition to specify two different search
%% orders; then when graphics are inserted (via the \includegraphics command),
%% the author just leaves off the extension.
%% (Of course, compilation will only work in both cases if the author has
%% provided appropriately-extensioned versions of the graphics file).
